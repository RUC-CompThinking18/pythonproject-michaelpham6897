# Comments
You have a few comments spread throughout that do well at establishing the "what" of the code around them. More extensive comments about the "why" of the code and longer comments to document functions would be welcome.

# Code Quality
The code itself is clean and runs without error. You did well at "thinking in functions" and encapsulating your code to prevent retyping things. However, the code produces no output when run, so I can't comment on the experience of running it.

# Ambition
I think there's the seed of an an interesting project here. However, in the absence the required README or seeing its output, it's hard for me to comment more than that.
